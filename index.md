The `C. F. Martin - New York` stamp on the back is not very precise stamped into the wood. The New York part looks like it was stamped two times. What do you think, is it a fake stamp? Have you seen something like this on other martins?

## Top

On the Top are several repaired cracks and underneath the soundhole the finish is completely off. I guess it is due the heavy use of a plectrum.

### Binding

The purfling is in overall good condition. There is only one part near the tail where the purfling is separating a bit from the top.

### Rosette

The colors of the rosette purfling is bleached out and there are several notches in the wood at the soundhole.
