The `C. F. Martin - New York` stamp on the back is not very precise stamped into the wood. The New York part looks like it was stamped two times. What do you think, is it a fake stamp? Have you seen something like this on other martins?

## Top

On the Top are several repaired cracks and underneath the soundhole the finish is completely off. I guess it is due the heavy use of a plectrum.

### Binding

The binding is in overall good condition. There is only one part near the tail where the binding is separating a bit from the top.

### Rosette

The colors of the rosette purfling is bleached out and there are several notches in the wood at the soundhole.

### Bridge

The saddle is definitely not original. It is out of bone and has a compensation on the B string. I do also believe the bridge itself is not an original pyramid one. The pins look original. What do you think?

### Belly in the Top

Unfortunately at some point in time the guitar must have strung with steel strings. There is a significant belly in the top. In real it looks worth than on the pictures.

It looks like the wrong treatment did also cause at least one brace to be broken.

## Back

The back is in very good condition. There is only one, nearly invisible hairline crack, which is not yet repaired. The wood does not have a spectacular grain, but the year lines are straight and it is perfectly quartersawn.

If you look carefully, you can see the hairline crack.

## Sides

On the sides are many scratches and on one side there are several repaired cracks, all within one small spot. Maybe the guitar was dropped down on this part. There is also one small part where the back is separating from the side.

Nice grain on the sides.

Many scratches.

In the veneer at the tail (what is the name of this part?) there is also one crack.

The back starts to seperate from the side.
