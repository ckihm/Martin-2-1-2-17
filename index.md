# Pictures of my Martin 2 1/2-17

Below I have added many detail pictures of my martin. The guitar should be build somewhere between 1867 and 1898. UMGF Member `hutton99` helped me to date it with the following information:

_First, what does the stamp state: "C. F. Martin" or "C. F. Martin & Co." If it has the "C. F. Martin" stamp it was made before August 1867. If not it was made between August 1867 and 1898. Martin stopped making this model in 1898 (although Martin did make some between 1909 and 1914)._

I believe it was dated under the top in pencil, but during a repair of the top cracks the pencil was sanded away except of a small part, which is not enough to guess any number from it. If you do find any other hint on the pictures to date it more precisely, please let me know.


## Martin Stamps

`C. F. Martin & Co - New York` stamp on the center strip.

`C. F. Martin & Co - New York` stamp on the neck block. The interesting thing is that the logo is not upside down. I found the following information on the wonderful website [www.vintagemartin.com](http://www.vintagemartin.com/stamps.html):


_With the exception of a few early examples with the Spanish foot, such as the one above, all of the neck block stamps I've seen on Martins from the very earliest to this example built in March, 1889 are upside down._

_All of the later neck block stamps read right side up.  The earliest example I've seen was stamped "2/90". This narrows the date of change from sometime between March, 1889 and February, 1890._

This limits the possible year of construction to 1889 - 1898!

The `C. F. Martin - New York` stamp on the back is not very precise stamped into the wood. The New York part looks like it was stamped two times. What do you think, is it a fake stamp? Have you seen something like this on other martins?

## Top

On the Top are several repaired cracks and underneath the soundhole the finish is completely off. I guess it is due the heavy use of a plectrum.

### Binding

The binding is in overall good condition. There is only one part near the tail where the binding is separating a bit from the top.

### Rosette

The colors of the rosette purfling is bleached out and there are several notches in the wood at the soundhole.

### Bridge

The saddle is definitely not original. It is out of bone and has a compensation on the B string. The pins look original.

### Belly in the Top

Unfortunately at some point in time the guitar must have strung with steel strings. There is a slightly belly in the top.

## Back

The back is in very good condition. There is only one, nearly invisible hairline crack, which is not yet repaired. The wood does not have a spectacular grain, but the year lines are straight and it is perfectly quartersawn.

![Image](./images/back/IMG_20210416_215845.jpg)

![Image](./images/back/IMG_20210416_215756.jpg)

If you look carefully, you can see the hairline crack.

![Image](./images/back/IMG_20210416_215825.jpg)

## Sides

On the sides are many scratches and on one side there are several repaired cracks, all within one small spot. Maybe the guitar was dropped down on this part. There is also one small part where the back is separating from the side.

Nice grain on the sides.

![Image](./images/sides/IMG_20210416_220236.jpg)

Many scratches.

![Image](./images/sides/IMG_20210416_220254.jpg)

![Image](./images/sides/IMG_20210416_220519.jpg)

The is one small spot with several scratches. All are repaired and stable.

In the veneer at the tail (what is the name of this part?) there is also one crack.

![Image](./images/sides/IMG_20210416_220004.jpg)


The back seperates from the side on a small spot.

## Neck

The neck on this one is narrow. It feals like the neck on an fender guitar, except that it has a V shape.

![Image](./images/neck/IMG_20210416_214323.jpg)

![Image](./images/neck/IMG_20210416_214405.jpg)

![Image](./images/neck/IMG_20210416_214831.jpg)

The finish is quite thick and there are some spots where the black finish is splittet away. There are some dings in the neck and the wood which is appearing there looks quite bright. It may be a maple neck.

![Image](./images/neck/IMG_20210416_214938.jpg)

![Image](./images/neck/IMG_20210416_215052.jpg)

A hairline crack can also be seen at the connection point between the headstock and the neck.

![Image](./images/neck/IMG_20210416_214732.jpg)

The ice cream cone heel look fine to me.

### Nut

The nut is not symetric and the action of the strings is very low.

### Fretboard

The fretboard doesn't look that good anymore. In some places small pieces have broken out.

![Image](./images/fretboard/IMG_20210416_225400.jpg)

![Image](./images/fretboard/IMG_20210416_225406.jpg)


### Frets

The frets are bar frets that look original. However, some of them protrude a little over the fingerboard and are quite low. The shape is almost square.

## Headstock

The Tuners for sure not original. These are the McStew tuners.

![Image](./images/headstock/IMG_20210416_214722.jpg)


Are these hairline cracks where the headstock is glued to the neck?

## Bracing / Lining

### Top Bracing

The guitar do have a fan bracing. The bracing is quite light. On top of the original bridge plate there is a relative new supporting plate glued on.

You can also see the repair job on the top and the side cracks.

### Back Bracing

The back does have 5 braces.

### Who was Ed Badeaux?

The name `E. or Ed Badeaux` has been scratched into the page in old script. Maybe it is the musician and guitar teacher [Edward Badeaux Jr. from Houston](https://de.findagrave.com/memorial/155439384/edward-raoul-badeaux). For any information about the potential owner, I would be happy as it would help to understand the history of this guitar better.
